This is firmware for an ESP32 to control an ADC1299 and losslessly transmits that data to a host PC over WiFi. It has many auxiliary functions, not limited to:
* Firmware updates over WiFi
* Access point mode: Device becomes an WiFi access point, which allows you to connect and update WiFi settings
* Time sync: Device and host time delay is calculated using avg. roundtrip time
