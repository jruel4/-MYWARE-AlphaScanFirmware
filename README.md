Welcome to the AlphaScan Firmware Archive

This is a backup of a private repository used during my time with MYWARE.

This is firmware for the ESP32 which controls an ADC1299 and losslessly transmits that data to a host PC. It has many auxiliary functions, not limited to:

- Firmware updates over WiFi
- Access point mode: Device becomes an WiFi access point, which allows you to connect and update WiFi settings
- Time sync: Device and host time delay is calculated using avg. roundtrip time
